## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the full **GitOps-managed configuration** for my personal Kubernetes cluster.
The cluster runs on **Talos Linux** and is fully declarative: every component, application, and configuration is defined in Git and continuously reconciled by **FluxCD**.

The cluster is a **single-node Talos Linux virtual machine on a Proxmox VE host**. TrueNAS runs as a separate VM on the same host and provides the network storage.
The focus of this environment is learning, experimentation, and long-running homelab workloads rather than high availability.

It was bootstrapped with [TrueForge Clustertool](https://trueforge.org/), and most applications are [TrueCharts](https://trueforge.org/) Helm charts.

Key goals of this setup:

* 🔁 **Reproducibility** – rebuild the entire cluster from Git
* 🔒 **Immutability & Security** – minimal OS, no SSH, API-driven management, CrowdSec in front of everything public
* 📈 **Observability** – metrics, logs, dashboards, alerts, and a public status page
* 🤖 **Automation-first** – dependency updates are tested in CI and merged without manual intervention

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions

### Proxmox VE
- One machine runs the Talos node next to TrueNAS and other VMs
- The Talos VM can be restarted, reached from the console, or rebuilt without touching the rest of the host
- Proxmox is monitored from the cluster as well

### Talos Linux
- Immutable, minimal OS reduces attack surface
- No SSH or package manager
- Fully API-driven, ideal for GitOps-based Kubernetes cluster

### FluxCD
- Continuous reconciliation instead of one-shot deployments
- Native Kubernetes integration, managed by the Flux Operator
- Works seamlessly with SOPS for encrypted secrets

### Single-Node Cluster
- Simplifies operations and reduces complexity
- Ideal for homelab and learning environments
- Focuses on reproducibility rather than high availability: nightly offsite backups make a rebuild easy

---

## 📡 Networking

This cluster assumes a **simple and reliable home network environment**.

- The Talos VM is connected to the home network through a Proxmox bridge
- No advanced routing, BGP, or multi-homing is assumed; Cilium is the CNI and MetalLB gives services their LAN IPs
- Two Traefik instances: `traefik-internal` for LAN-only apps and `traefik-external` for public apps
- Public apps are reached through a Cloudflare Tunnel into `traefik-external`
- Blocky serves DNS for the internal hostnames
- Remote access goes through Tailscale (subnet router and exit node)

## 🛡️ Security

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec-docs/main/crowdsec-docs/static/img/crowdsec_logo.png" alt="CrowdSec" width="200"/>
</div>

Everything that is reachable from the internet is protected by **[CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/)**:

~~~text
Internet → Cloudflare (WAF) → Cloudflare Tunnel → traefik-external + CrowdSec bouncer + CrowdSec WAF → app
~~~

- The CrowdSec bouncer (a Traefik plugin) runs on every route of `traefik-external`
- Every request is also checked by the CrowdSec AppSec WAF: virtual patches for known CVEs plus generic attack rules, updated from the CrowdSec Hub. Matches are blocked, and IPs that keep trying get banned
- Fail-closed: if the bouncer can't load or the WAF can't be reached, Traefik drops the public routes instead of serving them unprotected; the WAF runs two replicas
- The CrowdSec community blocklist blocks known bad IPs before they ever reach a login page; the instance is enrolled in the CrowdSec Console

### Network policies

Namespaces alone don't stop pods from reaching each other, so the apps get a `networkpolicy.yaml` next to their HelmRelease, enforced by Cilium:

- **Incoming:** public apps only accept `traefik-external`, and internal apps behind Authentik only accept `traefik-internal` (plus Homarr's status checks and Prometheus scrapes), so nothing can skip the login; databases and Redis only accept their own app
- **Outgoing:** apps that handle untrusted content (downloads, recipe imports, e-mail) reach DNS, their own database and the internet, but not the LAN or the rest of the cluster
- A few CiliumNetworkPolicies allow kube API access, which a plain ipBlock can't match (Tailscale, Headlamp)
- Each policy was mapped with Hubble before it was written, then tested from a pod without a policy of its own

## 🔐 Secrets Management

All secrets and credentials are stored in this repository **encrypted with SOPS** (age).

- Secrets are committed to Git in encrypted form
- Decryption happens inside the cluster via FluxCD
- Decryption keys are managed externally and are never stored in Git
- Each app keeps its own secrets next to it (`*.secret.yaml`); cluster-wide values live in `cluster-settings`
- Secret values never end up in HelmRelease objects: Flux fills them into a per-app Secret that the HelmRelease reads via `valuesFrom`
- A pre-commit hook refuses commits that contain unencrypted secrets
- This enables full GitOps workflows without exposing sensitive data
